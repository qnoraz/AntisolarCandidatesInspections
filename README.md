# AntisolarCandidatesInspections
You will find in this repository data used for the individual inspections of anti-solar candidates of the Noraz et al. (2022b) (A&A) study.
These anti-solar candidates are 99 Kepler targets, which were first selected with their high Rossby values, calculated with the analytical formula from the same study.
In order to keep the most reliable one, we first performed visual check of the Kepler field of view, with the 2MASS data base (https://kasoc.phys.au.dk/).
Then, then we performed additional rotation anaylsis of the light-curves in order to ensure the reliability of the detected Prot in Santos et al. (2019, 2021).

The light-curves are made available for the 99 targets in the 'LightCurves' folder.
You can find as well the plotted summary of the different rotation analysis in the 'FigsRot' folder.
Finally, Table C.1 of Noraz et al. (2022b) is made available in its full and machine-readable form : see TableC1v2.txt
